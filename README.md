# Fraud-Detection
Introduction
IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) works across a variety of AI and machine learning areas, including deep neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, and swarm intelligence. Today they’re partnering with Vesta, the world’s leading payment service company, seeking the best solutions for the fraud detection industry. The fraud prevention system used by Vesta is actually saving consumers millions of dollars per year. Researchers from the IEEE-CIS want to improve fraud detection accuracy but also the customer experiences.
Data Source
The data comes from Vesta’s real-world e-commerce transactions and contains a wide range of features from device type to product features, available in Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data). Only train_identity and train_transaction datasets will be used for this project.
